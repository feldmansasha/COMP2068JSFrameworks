# ASSIGNMENT 2
This is the app to find additional shifts in Rogers. I've worked there and this functionality wasn't available
in the company's time-tracking app. Instead managers used work WhatsApp, where messages can be lost and difficult to
track. In my app everyone can see shifts, but only registered user can add, accept and delete shifts. When accepting the shift
you can only enter your name and phone number. When shift is taken, no changes are allowed.

Additional features:
The main one - filter by store or location. Different store require different uniform and knowledge, so you can look for your specific brand
or find most convenient location fot you.
Also there's sort by date. User can do asc or desc.(shifts can be added in different sequence, for example Dec 24 can be created before 
shift of Decemeber 10), so sort is important.
Additionally, status column display availability and hides accept button
